    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Ayden Allyn and I am in my sophomore year of college. I chose computer science as my major for a variety of reasons. I love the creativity and freedom you have when coding and there is no better feeling than finishing a project you have spent countless hours on and are genuinely proud of. I also believe that software development will become more and more prominent in our daily lives and I would like to contribute in any way I can. Lastly, I love to learn, I know it sounds simple, but I believe in getting the most out of any opportunity that arises.</p>
